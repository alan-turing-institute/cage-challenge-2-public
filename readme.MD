You can now use a second argument of train.sh to specify the log directory of your experiment

in agents/baseline_sub_agents/configs.py is the config used to train various agenets including:
 - MAML
 - SAC
 - A2C
 - APEX DQN
 - IMPALA

performance from these algorithms can be seen in agents/agent_performance.txt
(more agents to be added as you can see based on not finished experiments)
